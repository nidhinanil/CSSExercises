# CSS Exercises

These exercises are a series of CSS related tasks intended to complement the HTML and CSS content on The Odin Project (TOP). They should only be done when instructed during the course of the curriculum.

When doing these exercises, please use all the documentation and resources you need to accomplish them. You are _not_ intended to have any of this stuff memorized at this point. Check the docs, use Google, do what you need to do (besides checking the solutions) to get them done.
